        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This little book
        is a translation from a collection of devotional thoughts published
        in France under the title of <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-q"
        xml:lang="fr">"Paillettes d'Or."</span> It is necessarily a
        selection, since the gold dust which suits French readers requires a
        fresh sifting for the English; but the value of most of the thoughts
        seems to me well to deserve the term of gold. There are many who will
        much enjoy having this little collection on their table, so as to be
        able to take it up and dwell upon some one of its grains at leisure
        times throughout the day's business.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the south of
        France, during the summer, little children and old and infirm poor
        who are incapable of hard work, in order to earn a livelihood, employ
        themselves in searching the beds of dried up rivers for <span lang=
        "fr" class="tei tei-q" xml:lang="fr">"Paillettes d'Or,"</span> or
        golden dust, which sparkles in the sun, and which the water carries
        away as it flows. What is done by these poor people and little
        children for the gold dust <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> has sown in those
        obscure rivers, we would do with those counsels and teachings which
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> has sown almost
        everywhere, which sparkle, enlighten, and inspire for a moment, then
        disappear, leaving but regret that the thought <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> did not occur to collect and treasure
        them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who is there that
        has not experienced at some time in his life those teachings so soft
        and gentle, yet so forcible, which make the heart thrill, and reveal
        to it suddenly a world of peace, joy, and devotion?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may have been
        but a word read in a book, or a sentence overheard in conversation,
        which may have had for us a two-fold meaning, and, in passing, left
        us touched with an unknown power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the smile
        on the lips of a beloved one whom we knew to be sorrowful, that spoke
        to us of the sweet joy of resignation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the open
        look of an innocent child that revealed to us all the beauty of
        frankness and simplicity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oh! if we had but
        treasured all the rays of light that cross our path and sparkle but
        for a moment; oh! if we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg
        013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had
        but engraved them on our hearts! what a guide and comfort they would
        have been to us in the days of discouragement and sorrow; what
        counsels to guide our actions, what consolations to soothe the broken
        heart!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How many new means
        of doing good!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is this simple
        work of gathering a little from every source&mdash;from nature, from books,
        above all, from mankind itself&mdash;that is the intention of one of your
        fellow-creatures, dear souls, you who long so to make your lives more
        holy and devout!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And in the same
        way as the gold dust, gathered and accumulated from the river's bed,
        was the means of bringing a little profit to the hearth, so would we
        endeavor to carry a little joy to your hearts, and peace to your
        souls.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gather, then,
        these little counsels; gather them with watchfulness; let
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014"
        id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> them for a moment penetrate
        deep into your heart; then scatter them abroad again, that they may
        go with their good words to the help of others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They will not be
        importunate, will not even ask to be preserved; they do not desire
        fame; all that they seek is to convey a transient blessing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For instance, we
          may like to pray at a certain place, with certain sentiments, and
          we think ourselves devout; we are gentle, polite, and smiling
          towards one person in particular; patient with those we fear, or in
          whose good opinion we would stand; we are devoted, charitable,
          generous, because the heart experiences an unspeakable pleasure in
          spending and being spent for others; we suffer willingly at the
          hands of some one we love, and then say we are patient; we are
          silent, because we have no inclination to speak; shunning society
          because we fail to shine there, and then fancy that we love

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Do not look with
          so much pride on this collection of virtues, but rather bring
          yourself to account for your faults. Take just one, the first that
          comes, impatience, sloth, gossip, uncharitableness, sulkiness,

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let no one
            think the interior life is incompatible with the life domestic
            and social, which is often so engrossing; just as the action of
            the heart maintained by the constant flow of blood in no way
            affects the outward movements, so is it with the life of the
            soul, which consists chiefly in the action of <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's Holy
            Spirit</span></span> within, that never hinders our social

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The interior
            life is an abiding sense of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> Presence, a
            constant union with Him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We learn to
            look upon the heart as the temple where <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> dwells, sometimes
            glorious as above, sometimes hidden as in the Holy Eucharist; and
            we act, think, speak, and fulfil all our duties, as in His
            Presence.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Its aim is to
            shun sin, and cultivate a detachment from all earthly things by a
            spirit of poverty; sensual pleasures by purity and mortification;
            pride by humility; dissipation by recollection.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a rule,
            people are prejudiced against an interior life. Some are afraid
            of it, and look upon it as a life of bondage, sacrifice, and
            restraint: <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg
            121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            others despise it, as nothing but a multiplicity of trifling
            rules, tending only to narrow-mindedness and uselessness, and fit
            only for weak minds. In consequence they are on their guard
            against it, and avoid the books that treat of it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They would
            serve <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> no doubt, but they
            will not subject themselves to the entire guidance of His Spirit;
            in short, it is far easier to bring a soul from a state of sin to
            that of grace, than it is to lead a busy, active, zealous person
            to the hidden, contemplative life of the soul.</p>

          window, and held in her hand a daisy, which she was questioning by
          gradually pulling it to pieces. What she wanted to ascertain I
          cannot tell; I only heard in a low murmur, falling from her pale

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was made by
          one who had suffered much for many years from numberless little
          worries, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg
          158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          occasioned by a relative, whose affection no doubt was sincere and
          devoted, but also too ardent, and wanting in discretion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There must be
          moderation in all things, even in the love we manifest, the care we
          take to shield them from trouble.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This recipe
          consists of but four simple rules, very clear, very precise. Behold
          them:&mdash;</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Always leave my
          friend something more to desire of me.</span></span> If he asks me
          to go and see him three times, I go but twice. He will look forward
          to my coming a third time, and when I go, receive me the more
          cordially.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is so sweet
          to feel we are needed, and so hard to be thought importunate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Be useful to my
          friend as far as he permits, and no farther.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An over-anxious
          affection becomes tiresome, and a multiplicity of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> beautiful sentiments makes them almost
          insupportable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Devotion to a
          friend does not consist in doing <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">everything</span></em> for him, but simply
          that which is agreeable and of service to him, and let it only be
          revealed to him by accident.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We all love
          freedom, and cling tenaciously to our little fancies; we do not
          like others to arrange what we have purposely left in disorder; we
          even resent their over-anxiety and care for us.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Be much occupied with
          my own affairs, and little, very little, with those of my
          friend.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This infallibly
          leads to a favorable result. To begin with, in occupying myself
          with my own affairs, I shall the more speedily accomplish them,
          while my friend is doing the same.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If he appeals to
          me for help, I will go through fire and water to serve him, but if
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">not</span></em>, then I do both myself and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name=
          "Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> him the greater
          service by abstaining. If, however, I can serve him without his
          knowledge of it, and I can see his need, then I must be always
          ready to do it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leave my friend
          always at liberty to think and act for himself in matters of little
          importance.</span></span> Why compel him to think and act with me?
          Am <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">I</span></em> the type of all that is
          beautiful and right? Is it not absurd to think that because another
          acts and thinks differently to myself, he must needs be wrong? No
          doubt I may not always say, <span class="tei tei-q">"<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">You are
          right</span></span>,"</span> but I can at any rate let him
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Try this recipe
          of mine, and I can answer for it your friendship will be
